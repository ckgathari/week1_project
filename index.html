    <p>I started learning html one week ago and I am proud of my progress so far. HTML is the programming language used to create a website&apos;s basic foundation. This means learning the language will offer you comprehensive knowledge of web pages&apos; working and other essential concepts.</p>
    <p>These are the projects I completed in my first week of coding </p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As the title of the page states, My name is Stephen Chege. A man( ooh yes I am a binary) open to all possibilities that comes his way. Am a graduate of JKUAT <em>also known as Juja boys in those days</em> and have several years of work experience. I started off as a banker and now am in Telecommunication which is a very dynamic and beautiful field.</p>
    <p>Being digital (has several meaning depending with audience) is a must in this day and age. It&apos;s this realization that has pushed me to continually want to learn more about digitizing things which you cannot do without learning programming among many other fields.</p>
    <p>I have interest in several areas</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Farming: I have a small farm where I grow coffee and two cows</li>
        <li>Docuseries: I enjoy watching documentaries</li>
        <li>DIY: I enjoy fixing anything on my own</li>
        <li>Football <em>How could I forget!</em></li>
    </ul>
