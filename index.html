    <p>I started learning html one week ago and I am proud of my progress so far. HTML is the programming language used to create a website&apos;s basic foundation. This means learning the language will offer you comprehensive knowledge of web pages&apos; working and other essential concepts.</p>
    <p>These are the projects I completed in my first week of coding </p>
    <ol>
        <li>hello-world</li>
        <p>This was my first web page where I introduced myself to the world.</p>
        <p>I used HTML to execute this project.  Below is a link to Hello world project!</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/ckgathari/hello-world">hello-world</a>
        <br><br>
        <li>My-pets</li>
